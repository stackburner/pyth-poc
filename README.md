How to solve the oracle problem?

One of the most challenging topics in decentralized finance infrastructure 
is for sure that most (if not every) smart contract relies on realiable off-chain
market data. While Chainlink serves as the oracle on the Ethereum chain, the Pyth-Network
seeks to do so on the Solana chain. 
When we think about trading processes latency and speed is key. The Pyth-Network is able to 
provide low-latency consensus market data which is the first step towards an 
infrastructure where market data is not heavily monetized property of centralized vendors anymore.
